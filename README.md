# Zootopia Project 

This project is designed to fetch detailed information about various animals using the free API provided by api-ninjas.com. By entering the name of an animal, users can retrieve comprehensive data about their chosen animal, which is then dynamically displayed on a web page.

The core functionality of this project is built with Python, which handles the data retrieval from the API and the generation of the web page. A predefined HTML template is used to ensure the web page is consistently styled and formatted. This project offers an educational and practical example of how to interact with an external API, process JSON data, and render it into a user-friendly web format.

Key features of the Animal Data Fetcher include:

* User Input: Users can input the name of the animal they are interested in.
* API Integration: The project fetches data from the api-ninjas.com API.
* Dynamic Web Page Generation: The retrieved data is injected into an HTML template to create a structured and informative web page about the selected animal.
